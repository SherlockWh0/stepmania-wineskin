# stepmania-wineskin
A StepMania Wineskin, for 64-bit Macs

Note:
If the Wineskin says it is broken/damaged, follow the instructions here: https://osu-mac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/install.html#step-2-repair-the-wineskin under alternate options but instead of ~/path/to/my/osu\!.app, use the path to your StepMania Wineskin. Also, giving it a good ol' test run might help!
